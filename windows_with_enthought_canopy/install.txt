Install instructions for Windows
===========================================

Approach A:  Using the Enthought Canopy Python Distribution

1) Install the Enthought Canopy Python Distribution:  

Use the full version.  The full version contains NetCDF4-Python, which the free version does not.  The full version is free for academics, $200 for others. Upgrade all packages.  Install NetCDF4-Python and Shapely if not already installed.  Check the numpy version by either looking in the Canopy package installer, or by doing:  import numpy; numpy.__version__   
Make a note of this version, as it needs to match the version used by Gohlke in step 3 below when you install the Cartopy binary. (e.g. numpy version 1.7.1)

2) Install PkKE:
  
Download PyKE from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke/files/latest/download
open a canopy command prompt and run "python setup.py install"

3) Install Cartopy:

Go to Gohlke's Python Extension Packages for Windows page
Check to make sure that Golke's numpy is the same version as your EPD (currently it's at 1.7.1), so you can then download the appropriate Cartopy binary (e.g. Cartopy-0.7.win-amd64-py2.7.exe)
Try running the .exe installer.  If it doesn't find your Canopy python, open 7-zip, browse to the exe, and select "Open Inside".  Then select the "PLATLIB" and extract the contents (cartopy folder and Cartopy egg info) to your Canopy site-packages folder.  For me this is in:
C:\Users\rsignell\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\Lib\site-packages 
Cartopy requires "shapefile.py" so download it from http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/ and also toss this in the site-packages folder. 

4) Install Iris:
open an Enthought Canopy command prompt. 
wget -O iris.zip --no-check-certificate https://github.com/SciTools/iris/archive/v1.4.0.zip
unzip -q iris.zip
cd iris-1.4.0
sudo python setup.py --with-unpack install
sudo touch /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Iris-1.4.0-py2.7-linux-i686.egg/iris/fileformats/_pyke_rules/compiled_krb/*
